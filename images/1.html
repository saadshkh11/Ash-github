			<h2>Detective Conan</h2>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<P>Case Closed, also known as Detective Conan (名探偵コナン Meitantei Konan), is an ongoing Japanese detective manga series written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama. It was serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday on January 19, 1994, and has been collected into 94 tankōbon volumes as of December 18, 2017. Due to legal considerations with the name Detective Conan, the English language releases from Funimation and Viz were renamed to Case Closed.[3] The story follows an amateur detective who was transformed into a child while investigating a mysterious organization, and solves a multitude of cases while impersonating his friend's father and other characters.</P>
